# Swerve ‚Äî an AI bookmarklet that ships entire pages to your brainy backend

What if you could beam any web page into an AI service with a single click? Swerve is a tiny bookmarklet that grabs the page you‚Äôre looking at (DOM, meta, selection, and more) and posts it to a web endpoint for processing‚Äîsummaries, insights, automations, you name it.

Swerve is for folks who want zero-install, works-everywhere capture that plays nicely with CSP, privacy, and the realities of the modern web.

## Why a bookmarklet?

- Zero install friction: drag to your bookmarks bar, click to run‚Äîworks on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge.
- Page-native context: runs in the page, has direct access to the live DOM and selection.
- IT-friendly: no extensions, no store approval, easy to audit (it‚Äôs just JavaScript).

## What gets captured

- HTML snapshot: document.documentElement.outerHTML
- URL, title, referrer, viewport size, user agent
- Selection (if any): text + minimal HTML

- Scroll position and visible region
- Timing hints: when capture started/finished

Optional (opt-in, may be blocked by CSP):

- Inline style snapshot (computed styles for visible elements)
- Text-only extraction (readability-like heuristic)

What we do NOT do by default:

- Fetch cross-origin resources
- Walk iframes from other origins
- Exfiltrate cookies or storage

## Architecture at a glance

Client (bookmarklet)
- Collect page snapshot and metadata
- Compress (optional) and chunk if needed
- POST to a configurable endpoint

Server (your AI web service)
- Accepts JSON or multipart chunks
- Reassembles snapshots
- Stores + enqueues for AI pipelines
- Returns a receipt (job id / link)

Notes
- Keep CORS open for your origin policy. The server must set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * (or your host) and allow POST/JSON + optional compression.
- For very large pages (>1‚Äì2 MB), prefer chunking (sequential POSTs with the same job token or session id).

## Bookmarklet behavior choices

- Transport: fetch() with CORS and keepalive true; fallback to navigator.sendBeacon for small payloads; optional form POST to a hidden iframe for hard CSP sites.
- Compression: lz-string inline (fast, browser-only) to reduce payload size by ~30‚Äì60% on text-heavy pages.
- Chunking: 256‚Äì512 KB chunks with ordered dispatch and finalization call.
- **Enhanced UI feedback**: Beautiful toast notifications with progress tracking, status updates, and customizable appearance that don't interfere with page content.

## Security and privacy

- Consent-first philosophy: the bookmarklet only sends the current page when you click it.
- Scope control: configurable to send selection only, above-the-fold only, or full DOM.
- Redaction hooks: client-side replacers for emails, numbers, patterns before upload.
- CSP-aware: tries fetch; if blocked, gracefully fails with guidance.
- No cookies sent: use a bearer token query param or header you control.

## Installing the bookmarklet (manual)

We‚Äôll ship a generated link in a later commit. For now:
- Create a new bookmark called ‚ÄúSwerve.‚Äù
- Paste this as the URL (placeholder, not final endpoint):

javascript:(async()=>{try{const E="https://service.example.com/ingest";const m={v:"0.1.0"};const d=document;const s=window.getSelection&&window.getSelection();const selectionText=s?String(s):"";const selectionHtml=s&&s.rangeCount?(()=>{const r=s.getRangeAt(0);const f=r.cloneContents();const e=d.createElement("div");e.appendChild(f);return e.innerHTML})():"";const payload={version:"0",page:{url:location.href,title:d.title||null,referrer:d.referrer||document.referrer||null,userAgent:navigator.userAgent,viewport:{width:window.innerWidth,height:window.innerHeight},scroll:{x:window.scrollX,y:window.scrollY}},snapshot:{html:d.documentElement.outerHTML,selectionText,selectionHtml,capturedAt:new Date().toISOString()},transfer:{encoding:"plain",chunk:{index:0,count:1}},client:{bookmarkletVersion:m.v,language:navigator.language}};const res=await fetch(E,{method:"POST",mode:"cors",keepalive:true,headers:{"content-type":"application/json"},body:JSON.stringify(payload)});if(!res.ok)throw new Error("upload failed" );alert("Swerve: sent ‚úÖ")}catch(e){console.error(e);alert("Swerve: failed ‚ùå")}})();

Replace https://service.example.com/ingest with your real endpoint.

## UI Feedback System

Swerve now includes a sophisticated, non-blocking UI feedback system that replaces basic alert() notifications with elegant toast messages. The system provides:

### Features

- **Toast Notifications**: Elegant, unobtrusive notifications that appear in corner positions
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators for chunked uploads and large operations  
- **Status Updates**: Clear visual feedback for different states (starting, in progress, success, failure)
- **Customizable Appearance**: Light/dark themes and positioning options
- **Isolated Styling**: CSS is namespaced to prevent conflicts with host page styles
- **Auto-dismiss**: Configurable timing with manual dismiss options
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes and devices

### Toast Types

- **Info** üí´: General information and status messages
- **Success** ‚úÖ: Successful operations and confirmations  
- **Error** ‚ùå: Error states and failure notifications
- **Warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è: Caution messages and important notices
- **Loading** üîÑ: In-progress operations with spinner animation

### Progress Indicators

For large page captures and chunked uploads, the system shows:
- Real-time chunk progress (e.g., "3/5 chunks uploaded")
- Upload speed and size information
- Time elapsed and estimated completion
- Detailed error messages if operations fail

### Demo

Try the interactive demo at `demo.html` to see all notification types and customization options in action.

### Building the Bookmarklet

The enhanced bookmarklet with UI feedback can be built using the included build script:

```bash
# Development version (readable)
node build.js

# Minified version (production)  
node build.js --minify

# Custom endpoint
node build.js --endpoint=https://your-service.com/ingest --minify
```

Built files are saved to the `dist/` directory:
- `bookmarklet.js`: Human-readable code
- `bookmarklet.txt`: Complete bookmarklet URL for copying

## Roadmap

- ‚úÖ **UI feedback system**: Elegant toast notifications with progress tracking (completed)
- ‚úÖ **Generator**: Produce a minified bookmarklet from /src and inject the configured endpoint + token (completed)
- Optional compression (lz-string) and chunking
- Readability-like text extraction mode
- On-page preview of what will be sent
- Per-site allowlist / denylist
- Tiny dashboard that shows job status after send

## Developer notes

- Bookmarklet size: keep under ~2‚Äì4 KB unminified for legibility (we‚Äôll ship a minified version later).
- CSP realities: some sites block inline script execution via strict CSP. In those cases, a bookmarklet may not run. We‚Äôll document fallbacks and a helper page that can open the current tab‚Äôs URL in a proxy capture if needed.
- Prior art: great inspiration from the bookmarklet ecosystem‚Äîe.g., WhatFont, perfmap, bullshit.js, and tools like bookmarkleter for building bookmarklets.
